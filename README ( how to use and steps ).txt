
Certainly! To create a simple currency converter using Python in Visual Studio Code, you can utilize an external API to fetch real-time exchange rates. For this example, we'll use the forex-python library which allows access to exchange rate data from various sources. First, install the forex-python library by running the following command in your terminal within Visual Studio Code:





pip install forex-python


Now, you can create a Python file (currency_converter.py or any name you prefer) and write the following code:



This code utilizes the CurrencyRates class from the forex_python library to convert an amount from one currency to another. When you run this script in Visual Studio Code, it will prompt you to input the amount, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to. It will then display the converted amount.

Replace amount_to_convert, from_currency, and to_currency with your desired values when prompted.

This is a basic example. You can expand upon this by adding error handling, integrating with more currency exchange APIs, creating a graphical user interface, or enhancing the user experience as per your requirements.
